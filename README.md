# What is a subgraph?

A subgraph is a tool used in decentralized applications built on blockchain technology, particularly those built on the Ethereum network. It is essentially a collection of GraphQL APIs that developers can use to extract data from the blockchain.

The benefits of using a subgraph are numerous. For one, subgraphs make it easier to query data from the blockchain in a structured and organized manner, allowing developers to efficiently extract the data they need for their applications. Subgraphs also help to reduce the load on the blockchain network by offloading the querying of data to a separate layer.

We have three subgraph deployed on Polygon Mumbai, Polygon Mainnet, Aurora Mainnet and Aurora Testnet. Our subgraphs use [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/en/)

`git clone https://github.com/open-format/subgraph.git`

### Install dependencies:

Install the required dependencies using either of the following package managers:

Using Yarn:

`yarn install`

Using NPM:

`npm install`

### Prepare the local subgraph

Prepare the local subgraph by running the following command:

`yarn prepare:local`

### Generate code for the local subgraph
